# Scroll loop

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/vincentorback/pen/zxRyzj](https://codepen.io/vincentorback/pen/zxRyzj).

Infinite scroll loop which positions you to the top or bottom of the container when the opposite end is reached.

Does not work on touch :( Maybe use this plugin? https://github.com/forcedotcom/scrollerjs/blob/development/src/plugins/endless-plugin.js
